# DSP_Grind
This repository is a work in progress, containing a collection of hands-on projects that I explore alongside my coursework (EE2004:Digital Signal Processing, IITM; Summer, 2025) to reinforce my understanding of Digital Signal Processing (DSP). It might also help others who are interested in accompanying their coursework with practical projects.

The content would largely be based off my coursework theory and MATLAB tutorials.
